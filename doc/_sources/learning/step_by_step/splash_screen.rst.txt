Splash screen
=============

Tutorial
--------

This is a simple tutorial to establish the basic idea of how the GUI
subsystem works. The goal is to create a really simple, static
splash screen.

Following is a file with the assets that will be used. These can be added directly to your project folder - no need to import them:

:download:`robisplash_assets.zip </files/robisplash_assets.zip>`.

Setting up
----------

Set the display resolution to 800x450 in Project Settings, and set up a new scene like this:

.. image:: /img/robisplashscene.png

.. image:: /img/robisplashpreview.png

The nodes "background" and "logo" are of :ref:`TextureFrame <class_TextureFrame>`
type. These have a special property for setting the texture to be
displayed, just load the corresponding file.

.. image:: /img/texframe.png

The node "start" is a :ref:`TextureButton <class_TextureButton>`.
It takes several images for different states, but only the normal and
pressed will be supplied in this example:

.. image:: /img/texbutton.png

Finally, the node "copyright" is a :ref:`Label <class_Label>`.
A custom font can be set for labels by editing the following property:

.. image:: /img/label.png

As a side note, the font was imported from a TTF, see :ref:`doc_importing_fonts`.
