Viewports
=========

Introduction
------------

Godot has a small but very useful feature called viewports. Viewports
are, as they name implies, rectangles where the world is drawn. They
have three main uses, but can flexibly adapted to a lot more. All this
is done via the :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` node.

The main uses in question are:

-  **Scene Root**: The root of the active scene is always a Viewport.
   This is what displays the scenes created by the user. (You should
   know this by having read previous tutorials!)
-  **Sub-Viewports**: These can be created when a Viewport is a child of
   a :ref:`Control <class_Control>`.
-  **Render Targets**: Viewports can be set to "RenderTarget" mode. This
   means that the viewport is not directly visible, but its contents
   can be accessed via a :ref:`Texture <class_Texture>`.

Input
-----

Viewports are also responsible of delivering properly adjusted and
scaled input events to all its children nodes. Both the root viewport
and sub-viewports do this automatically, but render targets do not.
Because of this, the user must do it manually via the
:ref:`Viewport.input() <class_Viewport_input>` function if needed.

Listener
--------

Godot supports 3D sound (in both 2D and 3D nodes), more on this can be
found in another tutorial (one day..). For this type of sound to be
audible, the viewport needs to be enabled as a listener (for 2D or 3D).
If you are using a custom viewport to display your world, don't forget
to enable this!

Cameras (2D & 3D)
-----------------

When using a 2D or 3D :ref:`Camera <class_Camera>` /
:ref:`Camera2D <class_Camera2D>`, cameras will always display on the
closest parent viewport (going towards the root). For example, in the
following hierarchy:

-  Viewport

   -  Camera

Camera will display on the parent viewport, but in the following one:

-  Camera

   -  Viewport

It will not (or may display in the root viewport if this is a subscene).

There can be only one active camera per viewport, so if there is more
than one, make sure that the desired one has the "current" property set,
or make it the current camera by calling:

::

    camera.make_current()

Scale & stretching
------------------

Viewports have a "rect" property. X and Y are often not used (only the
root viewport really uses them), while WIDTH AND HEIGHT represent the
size of the viewport in pixels. For Sub-Viewports, these values are
overridden by the ones from the parent control, but for render targets
this sets their resolution.

It is also possible to scale the 2D content and make it believe the
viewport resolution is other than the one specified in the rect, by
calling:

::

    viewport.set_size_override(w,h) #custom size for 2D
    viewport.set_size_override_stretch(true/false) #enable stretch for custom size

The root viewport uses this for the stretch options in the project
settings.

Worlds
------

For 3D, a Viewport will contain a :ref:`World <class_World>`. This
is basically the universe that links physics and rendering together.
Spatial-base nodes will register using the World of the closest
viewport. By default, newly created viewports do not contain a World but
use the same as a parent viewport (root viewport does contain one
though, which is the one objects are rendered to by default). A world can
be set in a viewport using the "world" property, and that will separate
all children nodes of that viewport from interacting with the parent
viewport world. This is specially useful in scenarios where, for
example, you might want to show a separate character in 3D imposed over
the game (like in Starcraft).

As a helper for situations where you want to create viewports that
display single objects and don't want to create a world, viewport has
the option to use its own World. This is very useful when you want to
instance 3D characters or objects in the 2D world.

For 2D, each Viewport always contains its own :ref:`World2D <class_World2D>`.
This suffices in most cases, but in case sharing them may be desired, it
is possible to do so by calling the viewport API manually.

Capture
-------

It is possible to query a capture of the viewport contents. For the root
viewport this is effectively a screen capture. This is done with the
following API:

::

    # queues a screen capture, will not happen immediately
    viewport.queue_screen_capture() 

After a frame or two (check _process()), the capture will be ready,
get it back by using:

::

    var capture = viewport.get_screen_capture()

If the returned image is empty, capture still didn't happen, wait a
little more, as this API is asyncronous.

Sub-viewport
------------

If the viewport is a child of a control, it will become active and
display anything it has inside. The layout is something like this:

-  Control

   -  Viewport

The viewport will cover the area of its parent control completely.

Render target
-------------

To set as a render target, just toggle the "render target" property of
the viewport to enabled. Note that whatever is inside will not be
visible in the scene editor. To display the contents, the render target
texture must be used. This can be requested via code using (for
example):

::

    var rtt = viewport.get_render_target_texture() 
    sprite.set_texture(rtt)

By default, re-rendering of the render target happens when the render
target texture has been drawn in a frame. If visible, it will be
rendered, otherwise it will not. This behavior can be changed to manual
rendering (once), or always render, no matter if visible or not.

A few classes are created to make this easier in most common cases
inside the editor:

-  :ref:`ViewportSprite <class_ViewportSprite>` (for 2D).
-  ViewportQuad (for 3D).
-  ViewportFrame (for GUI).

*TODO: Review the doc, ViewportQuad and ViewportFrame don't exist in 2.0.*
