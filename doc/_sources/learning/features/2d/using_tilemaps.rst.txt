Using tilemaps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
------------

Tilemaps are a simple and quick way to make 2D game levels. Basically,
you start with bunch of reference tiles (or pieces) that can be put in a
grid, as many times each as desired:

.. image:: /img/tilemap.png

Collisions can also be added to the tiles, allowing for both 2D side
scrolling and top down games.

Making a tileset
----------------

To begin, a tileset needs to be made. Here are some tiles for it.
They are all in the same image because artists will often prefer this.
Having them as separate images also works.

.. image:: /img/tileset.png

Create a new project and move the above png image into the directory.

We will be creating a :ref:`TileSet <class_TileSet>`
resource. While this resource exports properties, it's pretty difficult
to get complex data into it and maintain it. Here is what it would look like to
manually edit the resource:

.. image:: /img/tileset_edit_resource.png

There's enough properties to get by, and with some effort editing this
way can work, but the easiest way to edit and maintain a tileset is exporting
it from a specially-crafted scene!

TileSet scene
-------------

Create a new scene with a regular node or node2d as root. For each tile,
add a sprite as a child. Since tiles here are 50x50, enabling snap might be
a good idea.

If more than one tile is present in the source image, make sure to use
the region property of the sprite to adjust which part of the texture is being
used.

Finally, make sure to name your sprite node correctly. This will ensure
that, in subsequent edits to the tileset (for example, if added
collision, changed the region, etc), the tile will still be **identified
correctly and updated**. This name should be unique.

Sounds like a lot of requirements, so here's a screenshot that shows
where everything of relevance is:

.. image:: /img/tile_example.png

Continue adding all the tiles, adjusting the offsets if needed (that is, if you have
multiple tiles in a single source image). Again, *remember that their names must
be unique*.

.. image:: /img/tile_example2.png

Collision
---------

To add collision to a tile, create a StaticBody2D child for each sprite.
This is a static collision node. Then create a CollisionShape2D or
CollisionPolygon as a child of the StaticBody2D. The CollisionPolygon is
recommended because it is easier to edit.

.. image:: /img/tile_example3.png

Finally, edit the polygon, this will give the tile a collision.
**Remember to use snap!** Using snap will make sure collision polygons
are aligned properly, allowing a character to walk seamlessly from tile
to tile. Also **do not scale or move** the collision and/or collision
polygon nodes. Leave them at offset 0,0, with scale 1,1 and rotation 0
with respect to the parent sprite.

.. image:: /img/tile_example4.png

Keep adding collisions to the tiles until we are done. Note that BG is just
a background, so it should not have a collision.

.. image:: /img/tile_example5.png

OK! We're done! Remember to save this scene for future edit. Name it
"tileset_edit.scn" or something like that.

Exporting a TileSet
-------------------

With the scene created and opened in the editor, the next step will be to
create a tileset. Use Scene > Convert To > Tile Set from the Scene Menu:

.. image:: /img/tileset_export.png

Then choose a filename, like "mytiles.tres". Make sure the "Merge With
Existing" option is toggled on. This way, every time the tileset
resource file is overwritten, existing tiles are merged and updated
(they are referenced by their unique name, so again, **name your tiles
properly**).

.. image:: /img/tileset_merge.png

Using the TileSet in a TileMap
------------------------------

Create a new scene, using any node or node2d as root, and then create a
:ref:`TileMap <class_TileMap>` as
a child.

.. image:: /img/tilemap_scene.png

Go to the TileSet property of this node and assign the one created in
previous steps:

.. image:: /img/tileset_property.png

Also set the cell size to '50', since that is the size used by the
tiles. Quadrant size is a tuning value, which means that the engine will
draw and cull the tilemap in blocks of 16x16 tiles. This value is
usually fine and does not need to be changed, but can be used to fine tune
performance in specific cases (if you know what you are doing).

Painting your world
-------------------

With all set, make sure the TileMap node is selected. A red grid will
appear on screen, allowing to paint on it with the selected tile on the
left palette.

.. image:: /img/tile_example6.png

To avoid accidentally moving and selecting the tilemap node (something
common, given it's a huge node), it is recommended that you lock it,
using the lock button:

.. image:: /img/tile_lock.png

You can also flip and rotate sprites in the TileMap editor (note:
flipping the sprite in the TileSet will have no effect). Icons at the
top right of the editor allow flipping and rotating of the currently
selected sprite - you can also use A and S to flip horizontally and
vertically. With a brick pattern like this tutorial uses, flipping the
sprites would create unpleasant discontinuities unless you're flipping
an entire region of bricks, but for some kinds of tiles flipping can
be a convenient and space-saving feature.

Offset and scaling artifacts
----------------------------

When using a single texture for all the tiles, scaling the tileset (or
even moving to a non pixel-aligned location) will most likely result in
filtering artifacts like so:

.. image:: /img/tileset_filter.png

This is unavoidable, as it is the way the hardware bilinear filter
works. So, to avoid this situation, there are a few workarounds. Try the
one that looks better for you:


-  Disable filtering for either the tileset texture or the entire image
   loader (see the :ref:`doc_managing_image_files` asset pipeline tutorial).
-  Enable pixel snap (set: "Scene > Project Settings >
   Display/use_2d_pixel_snap" to true).
-  Viewport Scaling can often help with shrinking the map (see the
   :ref:`doc_viewports` tutorial).
-  Use a single image for each tile. This will remove all artifacts, but
   can be more cumbersome to implement.
